description: Empty template for user-confirmed semantic anchors. Use only when a user explicitly defines or corrects a reusable meaning, boundary, naming rule, or interpretation shortcut.

# Shared Semantic Anchors

This file starts empty by design. It is not a glossary and not a fact database.

## Rules

1. Only anchor semantics the user explicitly defines or corrects.
2. Store both meaning and non-meaning.
3. Preserve exact phrase boundaries.
4. Do not store assistant guesses as anchors.
5. Route troubleshooting-related anchors through the troubleshooting skill matrix when needed.

## Anchor Index

| Anchor ID | Phrase | Use when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ANCHOR-EXAMPLE` | example phrase | Replace after adoption. |
